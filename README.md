# Cheval 2.0

_Peter Kucirek | WSP_

Cheval is a Python package for high-performance evaluation of discrete-choice (logit) models. It's largely built upon
the Pandas, NumPy, and Numexpr packages; along with some custom Numba code for performance-critical bottlenecks.

The name is an acronym for "CHoice EVALuator" but has a double-meaning as _cheval_ is the French word for "horse" - and
this package has a lot of horsepower!
